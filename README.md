# SOLUTION TO LEETCODE PROBLEM 1768 - C#

This is my solution to LeetCode Problem 1768 - **Merge Strings Alternately** - in C# and a brief explanation

Link to problem on LeetCode -> [https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)

## PROJECT EXPLANATION

I have created a new project in _Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition_, selected the **Console App** project template, named the project **MergeStringsAlternately**, selected _.NET Core 3.1 (Out of support) Framework_.

I have two classes, **Program** class and **Solution** class.

## CODE EXPLANATION

### Program class 

I am using the automatically generated **Program** class and **Main** function.

```cs
internal class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
```

Firstly, the **word1** and **word2** text inputs (strings) are initialized by using basic string initialization. This part of code is commented out currently.

```cs
string word1 = "abc";
string word2 = "pqr";
```

Currently, the **word1** and **word2** text inputs (strings) are initialized by using next structure:

- Console Write -> where it displays which word needs to be inputted.
- string input = Console ReadLine -> where user input is stored into the text input (string).

```cs
Console.Write("Word1: ");
string word1 = Console.ReadLine();
Console.Write("Word2: ");
string word2 = Console.ReadLine();
```

Next, the **MergeAlternately** function from **Solution** class is called. It takes two strings (_string word1, string word_) and returns one string (_string fullWord_). The returned string is stored into a new string named **fullWord**.
The returned string is then printed out to the console.

```cs
string fullWord = Solution.MergeAlternately(word1, word2);
Console.WriteLine(fullWord);
```

At the end of the **Program** class there is next structure:

- Console WriteLine -> where it displays that the code is done processing.
- Console ReadLine -> where it waits for user input.

---

<details>
<summary>WHY DOES CONSOLE READLINE WAIT FOR USER INPUT?</summary><br>
To stop the code from automatically completing and exiting and us not being able to check the result of the code.<br>
</details>

---

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Done processing");
Console.ReadLine();
```

### Solution class 

I have created a new class and named it **Solution**. I have made it public. I have created the **MergeAlternately** function and mirrored the example provided in the LeetCode problem. I have made it static.

```cs
public class Solution
{
    public static string MergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) 
    {
```

Firstly, the **fullWord** text input (string) is initialized by using basic string initialization. It is set as empty string. This text input (string) will be used to store the merged text input (string) into and return it at the end of the function.

The **counter** numeric input (int) is initialized by using basic int initialization. It is set as _word1 + word2 Length_. This numeric input (int) will be used for specifying the number of times the **for** loop needs to run.

```cs
string fullWord = "";
int counter = word1.Length + word2.Length;
```

Secondly, the **for** loop is initialized that iterates from _0 to counter_.

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < counter; i++)
{
```

Inside the **for** loop, there are two **if** statements. Both check if **i** is less than _Length of the specified word_.

- If _i < word Length_ -> the intuition is that the word **HAS** letters remaining -> and it adds the specified letter of the specified word to the fullWord text input (string).
- If _i > word Length_ -> the intuition is that the word does **NOT HAVE** letters remaining -> and it does not add letter from the specified word to the fullWord text input (string).

The order of the words is important, as first a letter from the **word1** needs to be taken, and then a letter from the **word2**.

Notice that text input letters (or chars) can be accessed by using ```word[i]```.

```cs
if (i < word1.Length) { fullWord += word1[i]; }
if (i < word2.Length) { fullWord += word2[i]; }
```

At the end of the **Solution** class, the **fullWord** text input (string) is returned.

```cs
return fullWord;
```

## POTENTIAL MISTAKES (I HAVE MADE)

In **Solution** class, instead of initializing the **counter** numeric input (int), setting it as _word1 + word2 Length_, and using it in the **for** loop as the _count to value_, I have hardcoded the value of **100** to be the value the for loop counts to.

I have made this error based on the assumption on the constraint given in the problem itself -> ```1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100```

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
```

Even though this is **NOT WRONG**, it **IS TIME INEFFICIENT**.

---

<details>
<summary>WHY IS IT TIME INEFFICIENT?</summary><br>
Because it goes through <strong>200</strong> iterations every time, no matter the <i>Length of the words</i>.<br>
</details>

---

Any advice regarding making the code _MORE TIME AND SPACE EFFICIENT_ is **MORE THAN WELCOME**.

<!---
UPDATE: THIS CODE WAS COMMENTED OUT BECAUSE MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS OF THE SAME CODE WERE DONE TO CHECK THE VALIDITY OF THE PERCENTAGES. THE VALUES DIFFERED DRAMATICALLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT SUBMISSION TIME AND SPACE USAGE IS NOT ACCURATE INFORMATION, SO PROVISION OF SUCH INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY DETRIMENTAL TO THIS EXPLANATION.

The runtime is **38 ms** and beats **99.21 %** of csharp submissions which is not bad.

The memory usage is **40.2 MB** and 30.25 % of beats csharp submissions **BUT** it could be better. Any advice regarding that area is more than welcome.

# SOLUTION TO LEETCODE PROBLEM 1768 - C#

This is my solution to LeetCode Problem 1768 - **Merge Strings Alternately** - in C# and a brief explanation

Link to problem on LeetCode -> https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/

## PROJECT EXPLANATION

I have created a new project in _Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition_, selected the **Console App** project template, named the project **MergeStringsAlternately**, selected _.NET Core 3.1 (Out of support) Framework_.

I have two classes, **Program** class and **Solution** class.

## CODE EXPLANATION

### Program class 

I am using the automatically generated **Program** class and **Main** function.

```cs
internal class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
```

Firstly, I have initialized the **word1** and **word2** strings by using basic string initialization. This part of code is commented out currently.

```cs
string word1 = "abc";
string word2 = "pqr";
```

Currently, I am initializing the **word1** and **word2** strings by using _Console Write_ where I am specifying which word you are inputting and using _string input = Console ReadLine_ where I am storing user input to a variable.

```cs
Console.Write("Word1: ");
string word1 = Console.ReadLine();
Console.Write("Word2: ");
string word2 = Console.ReadLine();
```

Next, I am calling the function from **Solution** class which takes two strings (_string word1, string word_) and returns one string (_string fullWord_) and storing the returned string to a new string named **fullWord**.
I am printing out the returned string to the console.

```cs
string fullWord = Solution.MergeAlternately(word1, word2);
Console.WriteLine(fullWord);
```

At the end of the **Program** class I am doing a _Console WriteLine_ where I am showing that the code is done processing, and I am doing a _Console ReadLine_ to stop the code from automatically completing and exiting and us not being able to check the result of the code.

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Done processing");
Console.ReadLine();
```

### Solution class 

I have created a new class and named it **Solution**. I have made it public. I have created the **MergeAlternately** function to replicate the example from LeetCode problem. I have made it static.

```cs
public class Solution
{
    public static string MergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) 
    {
```

Firstly, I have initialized the **fullWord** string by using basic string initialization and set it as empty string. We will use this string to save the merged string to and return it at the end of the function.

I have initialized the **counter** int as well by using basic int initialization and set it as _word1 + word2 Length_. We will use this for specifying the number of times the **for** loop will run.

```cs
string fullWord = "";
int counter = word1.Length + word2.Length;
```

Secondly, I have created the **for** function that iterates from _0_ to _counter_.

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < counter; i++)
{
```

Inside the **for** function, I have two **if** functions. Both check if **i** is less than _Length of the specified word_.

- If it is less -> the intuition is that the word **HAS** letters remaining -> and it adds the specified letter of the specified word to the fullWord string
- If it is greater -> the intuition is that the word does **NOT HAVE** letters remaining -> and it does not run the code after the if function

The order of the words is important, as firstly we need to take the letter from the **word1** and then from the **word2**.

Notice that string letters (or characters) can be accessed by using ```word[i]```.

```cs
if (i < word1.Length) { fullWord += word1[i]; }
if (i < word2.Length) { fullWord += word2[i]; }
```

At the end of the **Solution** class I am returning the **fullWord** string.

```cs
return fullWord;
```

## POTENTIAL MISTAKES (I HAVE MADE)

In Solution class, instead of initializing the **counter** variable, setting it as _word1 + word2 Length_, and using it in the **for** loop as the _count to value_, I have hardcoded the value of **100** to be the value the for loop counts to.

I made this error based on the assumption on the constraint given in the problem itself -> ```1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100```

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
```

Even though this is **NOT WRONG**, it **IS TIME INEFFICIENT** because it goes through **200** iterations every time, no matter the _length of the words_.
